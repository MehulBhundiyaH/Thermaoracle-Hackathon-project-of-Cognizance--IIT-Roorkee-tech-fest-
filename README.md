# Thermaoracle-Hackathon-project-of-Cognizance--IIT-Roorkee-tech-fest-


Developed a machine learning model to predict hourly temperature based on weather data.

Overview:
Developed a machine learning model to predict the temperature (in Celsius) for the next hour based on weather conditions from the past six hours. This project was part of the "Thermaoracle" problem statement for the IIT Roorkee tech-fest hackathon.

Problem Statement:
The challenge involved predicting temperature using historical weather data, including parameters such as wind speed, humidity, and pressure. The model needed to handle missing values and provide accurate predictions during offline testing at the event.

Key Features:

      Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by filtering out missing values and handling large negative numbers.
      Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features from the weather data to improve model accuracy.
      Model Development: Implemented various regression algorithms using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to predict the temperature, with a focus on optimizing performance.
      Code Submission: Submitted a Python notebook (.ipynb) detailing the approach, methodology, and prediction pipeline.
      Offline Testing: Deployed the model for offline testing during the event, demonstrating real-time prediction capabilities.
      
Technologies Used:

    -> Python
    -> Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
    -> Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
    -> TensorFlow for advanced regression techniques
    -> Jupyter Notebook for code illustration and documentation
    
This project showcases my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data, perform rigorous data preprocessing, and develop predictive models under competitive conditions.
